# NavService
This is a rest service to support the vision-based navigation system I am building as my Master's degree capstone project.

See the postman file for the specifics.

Basically this service provides a way for multiple vehicles to easily access maps, object detection models, log their locations, images, and other various things.

It also provides methods for assigning tasks to vehicles.

This serves as the backend to the BotCaptain app.
